    "For the current design cycle, the descion was made to construct a new parachute. The reasons for this descision were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Legacy knowledge about how parachutes are constructed was not passed one during the COVID era, and some of it was at risk of being lost as the last people who sewed the parachute (Roman, Zach) graduated. Sewing the new parachute would serve as knowledge transfer.\n",
    "2. The rocket underwent significant modifications and as a result, became much lighter during this design cycle. This meant that the parachute could be made smaller. As this eases packing, volume constraints, tangling risks, and mass, this would be a worthwhile pursuit for the recovery system.\n",
    "3. The old parachute has begun to deteriorate due to the overwhelmingly large amount of testing conducted on it. If it was chosen to fly this year, it would have possibly needed significant maintenance and cleaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The format of this document is a jupyter notebook in the github simulink workspace due to the necessity of carrying out calculations and also since the calculations may involve the creation of simulink models (although this is admittedly unlikely).\n",

    "A mistake in the initial draft was caught, which was the lack of a square root term in the nominal diameter scaling equation. After this was corrected, it became clear that the size of the parachute would not descrese significantly, despite a significant reduction in the weight of the rocket. It was decided at this point that the design will be performed to the nominal mass case. No additional safety factors or analysis will be performed on the maximum mass case, with only a check to ensure that it still conform to the DTEG requirements. Some notes on vent sizing have also been summarized from slack threads and ongoing discussion.\n",

    "# Sizing approach \n",
    "\n",
    "The parachute from the previous design cycle was relatively well characterized. It had an unreefed drag area of rouhgly $14 m^2$, against a constructed diameter of 3.8 meters. This value is based on experimental data collected during Truck Test 4 and analyzed during the 2022 competition cycle using the 'truck-test-rapid-analyzer' script, code for which is available on github (https://github.com/waterloo-rocketry/truck-test-rapid-analyzer). The specific analysis file package is also uploaded to the team drive at Recovery/2023/TruckTest4AnalysisRedone. It must be noted that there is uncertainty in this unreefed area due to the necessity of data filtering via hand-picked constants. This is explored to some extent in the podium presentation and can be observed directly by changing the threshold values in the script-generated excel spreadsheet. The $14 m^2$ (corresponding to the 150 ft^2 in the original units of the calculator) is actually a conservative underestimate based on the range of values given by the data analysis, with values going up to 160 - 170 for the higher windspeed cases. Therefore, this lower value can be used with some degree of reliability. This also gives a useful value of the drag coefficient with respect to the constructed-diameter-area (which should stay the same for the new parachute, assuming that their characteristics are the same):"

    "Given that the parachute to be sewn will employ a very similar construction, the best way to size it would be a scaling of the old parachute. In the manual (Parachute Recovery Systems Design Manual, T.W. Knacke, 1992), almost all drag area calculations are ultimately tied to the 'nomial diameter' of the parachute, which is a function of the total fabric surface area. Therefore, the selected approach for sizing the parachute would be to calculate a new nominal diamater assuming the same relative drag coefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sizing parachutes could be done liberally to place a large factor of safety on the landing loads. In the author's opinion, such a design philosophy is appropriate for a dual-separation system, which by its nature allows large parachutes and simple parachute bays, where tangling is not a significant concern. It also lends itself well to well-chaterized legacy systems where the risk of main at apogee even is low. However, in a single-bay reefing system, a larger parachute carries a significant penalty to system development and reliability. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a newly developed system, a 'main at apogee' is a possible scenario. A larger main would exarcerbate the effects of this scenario and could lead to system loss should the parachute drift into the white sands missile range. It also carries the disadvantage of larger drift in the last 1500 ft, although this is smaller concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mass that the new parachute would need to target would be 84.2 lbs (which is the expected load as predicted in the cycle 2.2 load analysis). Additionally, a check will need to performed to ensure that the parachute still falls within the allowable envelope even at the maximum load case, which is 92.9 lbs as per the cycle 2.2 load analysis. However, for this check, no additional factors of safety or climactic considerations will be performed, since doing so will necessistate a larger parachute and lead back to the risks of large parachutes as discussed in the previous paragraph \n",
    "\n",
    "The laod case is contrasted with the old parachute that was to be used on the projected 100 lb KotS rocket (which ultimately grew to 105.51 lbs), and was sized for a 113 lbs SotS rocket, which was ultimately 104.2 lbs (values taken from the respective reports, available on the drive or the website). \n",

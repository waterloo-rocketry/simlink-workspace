    "# Introduction and rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "For the current design cycle, the descion was made to construct a new parachute. The reasons for this descision were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Legacy knowledge about how parachutes are constructed was not passed one during the COVID era, and some of it was at risk of being lost as the last people who sewed the parachute (Roman, Zach) graduated. Sewing the new parachute would serve as knowledge transfer.\n",
    "2. The rocket underwent significant modifications and as a result, became much lighter during this design cycle. This meant that the parachute could be made smaller. As this eases packing, volume constraints, tangling risks, and mass, this would be a worthwhile pursuit for the recovery system.\n",
    "3. The old parachute has begun to deteriorate due to the overwhelmingly large amount of testing conducted on it. If it was chosen to fly this year, it would have possibly needed significant maintenance and cleaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The format of this document is a jupyter notebook in the github simulink workspace due to the necessity of carrying out calculations and also since the calculations may involve the creation of simulink models (although this is admittedly unlikely).\n",

    "# Sizing approach \n",
    "\n",
    "The parachute from the previous design cycle was relatively well characterized. It had an unreefed drag area of rouhgly $14 m^2$. This value is based on experimental data collected during Truck Test 4 and analyzed during the 2022 competition cycle using the 'truck-test-rapid-analyzer' script, code for which is available on github (https://github.com/waterloo-rocketry/truck-test-rapid-analyzer). The specific analysis file package is also uploaded to the team drive at Recovery/2023/TruckTest4AnalysisRedone. It must be noted that there is uncertainty in this unreefed area due to the necessity of data filtering via hand-picked constants. This is explored to some extent in the podium presentation and can be observed directly by changing the threshold values in the script-generated excel spreadsheet. The $14 m^2$ (corresponding to the 150 ft^2 in the original units of the calculator) is actually a conservative underestimate based on the range of values given by the data analysis, with values going up to 160 - 170 for the higher windspeed cases. Therefore, this lower value can be used with some degree of reliability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the parachute to be sewn will employ a very similar construction, the best way to size it would be a scaling of the old parachute. In the manual (Parachute Recovery Systems Design Manual, T.W. Knacke, 1992), almost all drag area calculations are ultimately tied to the 'nomial diameter' of the parachute, which is a function of the total fabric surface area. Therefore, the selected approach for sizing the parachute would be to calculate a new nominal diamater assuming the same relative drag coefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mass that the new parachute would need to target would be 93 lbs (which is the maximum load as predicted in the cycle 2.2 load case). This is contrasted with the old parachute that was to be used on the projected 100 lb KotS rocket (which ultimately grew to 105.51 lbs), and was sized for a 113lbs SotS rocket, which was ultimately 104.2 lbs (values taken from the respective reports, available on the drive or the website). \n",
    "\n",
    "Sizing parachutes could be done librally to place a large factor of safety on the landing loads. In the author's opinion, such a design philosophy is appropriate for a dual-separation system, which by its nature allows large parachutes and simple parachute bays, where tangling is not a significant concern. However, in a single-bay reefing system, a larger parachute carries a significant penalty to system development and reliability. "

    "Due to the nature of the reefing system, only one parachute needs to be sized, with the reefed stage being fully controlable by the length of the reefing line, which is done after the construction of the parachute itself. Thus, the driving factor of the sizing is the ground impact velocity. As per the DTEG, it is recommended at lower than 30 ft/s."
